    <!-- Exercise 1
Exercise 2

Create an external Javascript program and link it to an HTML document.  It has to print the following message in the console "Hi my name is Martin". Once the HTML file is opened, it should display the message from the Javascript.

Exercise 3

Extend the previous example (Basic exercise 2) by adding the following text to it "and I am 25 years old". This text should come from the script within the body tag in the HTML document. The age value should come from a variable.   -->
    <script src="basic2.js"></script>
    <script>
      var age = 25;
      console.log("and I am " + age + " years old");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
